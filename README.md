**Learning Language Demos**

This repository contains a collection of small projects and demos I developed while learning various programming languages. Each demo focuses on a specific concept or feature of the language, helping me to improve my coding skills and deepen my understanding of different programming paradigms.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the projects!
